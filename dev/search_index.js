No specialised data structures are utilised and data is expected to be stored in matrices of Floats. The methods also do not check dimensions of inputs or bounds in for loops - it is expected that users will take care to avoid mistakes. Currently the emphasis is on speed (not convenience) with a view to implement GPU versions of these methods in the future.","category":"page"},{"location":"kmeans/#Clustering-Methods","page":"K-Means Clustering","title":"Clustering Methods","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"kmeans/","page":"K-Means Clustering","title":"K-Means Clustering","text":"kmeans\nkmeans!","category":"page"},{"location":"kmeans/#VectorDataUtils.kmeans","page":"K-Means Clustering","title":"VectorDataUtils.kmeans","text":"kmeans(data, number_of_centres; [update_threshold = 0.0])\nkmeans(data, number_of_centres, initialise_method; [update_threshold = 0.0])\n\nEstimate cluster centres from data using the k-means clustering algorithm.
